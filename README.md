# Chrono Game - Timing Practice Race Simulator üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚è±Ô∏è

Timing Practice Race Simulator is a web application designed to help timing professionals improve their skills. The app simulates a configurable "rain" of numbers (representing cyclists) racing across a track. Users can adjust settings such as the number of cyclists, speeds, cyclist size, number range, and even the race orientation (horizontal or vertical). During the race, users record times and compare them with the actual finish times, enabling performance analysis and improvement.
